        We understand that data privacy is a significant concern for many people. Therefore, we want to be transparent
        about the data we collect to allay any fears. The information we gather pertains to how Shoko is used, such as
        error messages and performance metrics. This data allows us to swiftly identify and resolve issues and
        prioritize improvements to make the software more stable and user-friendly.

        We want to assure our users that we take data privacy seriously and only collect non-identifiable information to
        improve Shoko, meaning that we don&apos;t collect any personal information that could be used to identify you.
        We&apos;re not interested in knowing the specific titles in your collection or the content you watch. Our sole
        objective is to improve Shoko, and the data we collect will help us achieve this goal.
